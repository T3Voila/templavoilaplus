    <f:comment>Needs to be removed before final release.</f:comment>
    <p class="lead text-danger">You are using software which is in alpha state, the process of migration isn't complete and ready! Maybe TV+ change the style of configuration lately, implement a complete differently solution. So please do this only inside testing environments. This migration may need to run after every git checkout or point release update from the same TV+ 7 configuration base and this can lead to the possibility that it overwrites changed data.</p>
    <f:be.infobox title="Alpha state software" state="1">
        <ul>
            <li>Only use on testing environments.</li>
            <li>Needs to run in later versions again from same original base</li>
            <li>May overwrite data which you changed already</li>
        </ul>
    </f:be.infobox>

    <p class="lead">TV+ 8 changes the configuration massively, as all configurations happen now in files and do not reside inside the database anymore. Till yet this was only possible with the experimental Static DataStructures. This change makes it easier for deployment strategies and creating theme extensions and you get the ability to manage your design better inside version control systems (VCS). Handling design updates on your website should work better. And as we only have one map field in the pages/tt_content tables editors cann't breake the ds/to fields anymore.</p>
    <p class="lead">To get all this happen, TV+ 8 introduce a concept of "configuration places". Every place contain one aspect of configuration, we removed the mixing of different aspects so parts of the configuration can better reused. Breaking the hard binding between DataStructure and Template allows us also to use different Template Engines, till yet the old XPath is reimplemented but others can be provided by extensions or write your own one. Also different loaders allows us to use modern configuration languages, together at same time. Implemented are the good old XML and the newer Yaml.</p>
    <p class="lead">Every place define a LoadSaveHandler, a Handler for the configuration type and an entry point to find the configuration files. We use three different configuration types. The one is already known as DataStructures, which now only contain the structuring of data, no processing instructions or anything else. The second one is the TemplateConfiguration, it defines which template file to use, which RenderHandler should be called and mostly configures the RenderHandler with information about how to render (for example the XPath RenderHandler needs to know which variable have which XPath) and what else is needed for a good rendering. The newly third configuration type is the MappingConfiguration (may change the name to ProcessingConfiguration) it defines what to do with the values of the DataStructure fields, of row fields or of TypoScript pathes and into which names of the template they should be transfered. This mapping information is also the part which your editor will select later on page or content level.</p>
    <p class="lead">This update script helps you to move your configuration out of your database (or the static DataStructures) and your templates from fileadmin into an extension, which you can check into your VCS to manage changes with history and backup.</p>
    <p class="lead">Enough told for the moment, start your update right now, TV+ will guide you with multiple steps to a hopefully functional system. At first we need to check, what your current system includes and how this update script can help you.</p>

    <f:comment>This box should be removed and changed to a Step which asks if you did a backup

    <f:comment> What TODO with the storage_pid check? We may need a check if there is more then one storage_pid to get different theme extensions.
